# What is this

My fourth project during the Technigo bootcamp.
Assignment: **Build a Cluedo mystery picker**.

## How I started

I did as I have done for every project so far, watching all the weekly material and doing the labs. After that I felt pretty comfortable to get going with the project.

### What I struggled with and should improve for next weeks project

I didn't really struggle with anything project related this week. I was a pretty straight forward task and I enjoyed it.

However, I had a goal for myself that if I was done early this week I should not do any deep dives and just allow myself to have a few days off. That was really hard for me and it's something I need to practice on. I did the JavaScript deep dives but I did manage not do dive into the CSS to much.

### What I'm proud of

I'm proud of the fourth card I've done. It randomises time, am/pm and date. It also formats numbers that are less than 10 to have a zero before the number e.g. 7 is written as 07. However every year is leap year in my cluedo game so that's something I need to look into how to fix in the future.

## If I had more time

The site is kind of responsive but I would hav made it better if I had more time, and obviously made it a bit more aesthetically pleasing.
